# NLP Project for Multi-Label Classification of English Quotes  
This is a natural language processing project that aims to perform multi-label classification of English Quotes.
In this project I aim to perform the following tasks:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the datatset
- Data cleaning, tokenization, stop word removal & lemmetization
- Vectorization using TF-IDF
- Training a baseline model using Naive Bayes Classifier
- Training more advanced models using Deep Learning approach
- Evaluating the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and f1 score.
