This is a natural language processing project that aims to perform multi-label classification of English Quotes.
In this project I aim to perform the following tasks:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning, Tokenization, Stop Word Removal & Lemmetization
- Vectorization using TF-IDF
- Training a baseline model using Multi-Label Naive Bayes Classifier
- Training more advanced models using a Deep Learning approach
- Evaluating the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and f1 score.
